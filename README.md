## About
This is a tic-tac-toe game in which two players can play from the beginning (with an empty grid) to the end (until a draw occurs or one of the players wins).
Process:
1. At the beginning of the game, an empty 3x3 game grid is printed.
2. Creates a game loop where the program asks the user to enter the coordinates of the cell, analyzes the progress for correctness and shows the grid with changes if everything is in order. Note that the first player must play as X, and his opponent plays as O.
3. The game ends when someone wins or there is a draw. Output of the game result.
